                    <p>The dodo is a creature that moves around with little <br> speed and can be found on the beaches, hills and <br> forests around the island. If they are attacked they will <br> not fight back even if their egg is taken.</p>

                    <p>The raptor is a dinosaur that will attack you on sight. <br> They attack creatures smaller or the same size as themselves. <br> When they are attacking in a pack of 3 or more they get a <br> pack buff and with their high speed they can be hard to escape. If you ever get attacked by a raptor you should run into water or run behind a door and close it.</p>

                    <p>The carno will attack humans but they will prioritize <br> other dinosaurs. It lives mainly on flat, clear ground where <br> it can use its speed. It does not mind running away from larger predators instead of fighting.</p>
